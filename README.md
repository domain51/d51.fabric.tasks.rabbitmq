d51.fabric.tasks.rabbitmq
=========================
Fabric tasks for handling basic management tasks on RabbitMQ


Requirements
------------
This has been built to be used with the 1.0a version of the [Fabric fork][]
maintained by [Travis Swicegood][].  It might be usable with other versions of
Fabric, but your mileage may vary.


Usage
-----
You can import the individual tasks into your current fabfile:

    from d51.fabric.tasks.rabbitmq import *

Or, you can import the module and execute the tasks that way:

    from d51.fabric.tasks import rabbitmq


Tasks
